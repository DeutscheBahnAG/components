## Fonts

To link all fonts required to display DB React components, add to your main Sass file:

```scss
@import '@db-design/styles/global/fonts';
```

Or:

```scss
@import '@db-design/styles/global';
```

This will link to WOFF and WOFF2 files on our CDN. The CDN will be kept up-to-date with the latest versions of our fonts.
